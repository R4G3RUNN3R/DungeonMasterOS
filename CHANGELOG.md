# Changelog

## 2026-04-18
- Deployment: added a fresh commit to force Railway to redeploy current `main`.
- Auth/routes: confirmed `server/routes.ts` already uses stable logged-in visitor identity (`user-{id}`) before falling back to `x-visitor-id` or anonymous IDs.
- Expected impact: logged-in users keep a stable character/campaign identity, which unblocks Enter the World and character import flows after redeploy.
- Risk: low. No gameplay logic changes in this commit beyond triggering a fresh deployment of the already-fixed route code.

## 2026-04-17
- Auth: production now fails fast when `JWT_SECRET` is missing instead of silently falling back to the known development secret. This closes a session-forgery risk and makes misconfiguration obvious during deploy/startup.
